= ToolsForLocales

== Description

A small collection of tools for locales wannabe project. Currently supports only sort_tokens.

=== Sort Tokens

When working with lot of tokens it's best practice to arrange the keys in alphabetical order.
That is what this task does.

Give a yaml file like this:

  en:
    admin:
      menu:
        company: "Company"
        about_us: "About Us"
      flashes:
        success: "Success"
        failure: "Failure"

The result will be:

  en:
    admin:
      flashes:
        failure: "Failure"
        success: "Success"
      menu:
        about_us: "About Us"
        company: "Company"

== Install

Currently is tested on rails3+ and ruby 1.9.3
